Quick setup with Exim 4
-----------------------
ddgrey Debian package is already configured for the Exim 4 user.

Add the lines in /usr/share/doc/ddgrey/exim4.conf to your exim4 rcpt ACL;
this is located in /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/30_exim4-config_check_rcpt if you
use the Debian split exim configuration.

Otherwise, see README from section "peering with other ddgrey servers".
