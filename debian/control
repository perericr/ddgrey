Description: ddgrey - dynamic distributed greylisting daemon
 DDgrey acts as a normal greylisting daemon, being queried over a UNIX domain
 socket, and answering if a mail should be allowed, defered or denied.
 .
 It can also get reports from the MTA (currently by reading exim4 log files)
 about suspect activities, and receive reports from spamtraps, spam reporting
 aliases and ddgrey servers on other hosts (normally on your other MX servers).
 Using this information, ddgrey can adjust the greylisting delay for a specific
 host from no greylist at all, to a long delay or outright blacklisting.
